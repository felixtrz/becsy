# Fecsy

> [Becsy](https://github.com/LastOliveGames/becsy) is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework for TypeScript and JavaScript that will make it nearly effortless to write performant, multi-threaded code.

Fecsy, a fork of Fecsy, eliminates the incomplete multi-threading code and converts all operations to synchronous. This adaptation is especially beneficial for integration with WebXR Three.js applications, which do not permit asynchronous function calls within the render loop.

Please [read the docs](https://felixtrz.github.io/fecsy/) for all the details, jump right in to see some heavily annotated [examples](./examples), and [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/X72ct6hZSr) for help and fun discussions!
